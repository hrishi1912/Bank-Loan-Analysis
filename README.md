    - Utilized SQL for data extraction and DAX to calculate key metrics, including an Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio of 30%.
- __Interactive Visuals:__
    - Created dynamic visuals to analyze loan performance by state and purpose, distinguishing between Good (85%) and Bad (15%) loans.
- __Detailed Analysis:__
    - Enabled in-depth insights with interactive filters and drill-through options to explore loan statuses and repayment patterns.
- __Performance Optimization:__
    - Improved data refresh by 25% using Power BIâ€™s incremental data load, reducing report generation time.
- __Approval Trends:__
    - Monitored approval trends across loan tiers, revealing a 12% higher approval rate for loans below $50,000.
